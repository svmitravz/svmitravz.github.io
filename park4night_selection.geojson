It is a very peaceful place with a beautiful view over the forest and valley. We felt safe here. There is a sheep herd with sheeps but they dont come close. The only bad sides are that you are full in sight however the few people we saw greet us super happy and that cars are passing which can make it noisy during the day but during the evening and night cars come rarely at these local roads. its close to very unique pyramids",

My favorite place in MontenegroThe hiking trail is worth it especially on the way back with beautiful views of the lake in the distance. The beginning is easy then it climbs hard and its rocky. Absolutely not Level Easy as indicated on the sign pictured.To come from the panoramic road follow the red markers of the hike. Asphalt road in good condition until the end. Overall straight ahead and the only place you have to choose is on the left.Only for vans and small riders because the end of the road is even narrower.
