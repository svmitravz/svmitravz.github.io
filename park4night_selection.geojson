FIRE In the period in which we went the mayors ban was in force given the current dry period but only and exclusively for improvised fires on the ground it was not a problem given the presence of both stone barbecues.

We no longer listen to the road and rediscover the songs of the locusts in the morning. There is no passage because this road leads to the railway which is a dead end.

We mostly meet hikers and a doe at breakfast There is a refuge that makes restaurant with cold cuts and local pastries. Several hikes possible.

The super friendly organisation of the sagra basically invited us to even spend the night. We havent gone back since the sagra but are planning to. You can make a nice walk to the castellaccio uphill. No services. There is a water point for the graveyard but its not drinkable water.The road to get there is narrow steep and there are very sharp turns Uturns basically.

Theres nowhere to turn around so we backed up the path until we were in the forest out of sight of the tarmac. Theres a slightly wider area before the path starts going downhill where we found a perfectly level spot not wide enough to turn around though. Not recommended if its raining  looks like it can get pretty muddy. Best for vans and smaller rigs. Sadly there was some rubbish on the sides as we went down the path but it was OK where we stopped. Great for our dog since it was far enough from the road. Bonus we had no mosquitoes",

Its the right way. Those who dare can drive up the steep dirt road to the right and will be rewarded with a great 360 view.You can even stand up there even if you are standing in the middle of a hilltop. You see everything and then you are seen from all sides.If this place is too risky for you you can visit a good alternative a little further down the gravel road. The view is just as great there but you are a bit more protected especially with larger campers.",
