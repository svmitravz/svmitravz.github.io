You can make a nice walk to the castellaccio uphill. No services. There is a water point for the graveyard but its not drinkable water.The road to get there is narrow steep and there are very sharp turns Uturns basically.

Its the right way. Those who dare can drive up the steep dirt road to the right and will be rewarded with a great 360 view.You can even stand up there even if you are standing in the middle of a hilltop. You see everything and then you are seen from all sides.If this place is too risky for you you can visit a good alternative a little further down the gravel road. The view is just as great there but you are a bit more protected especially with larger campers.",
