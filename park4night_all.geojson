We were able to stretch out our hammocks and enjoy the view A small cool stream allowed us to shower.

The toilets open around 3060 minutes after the caretaker arrives as his wife cleans the toilets thoroughly beforehand. It is recommended to arrive before the official closing time in order to pay for the night straight away otherwise you will be woken up in the morning and charged. Vehicles over 2.20m cannot drive onto the site at any time. There are a few toilets on the lake site but they all usually close around 700 p.m. It is recommended not to position yourself at an angle or outside the usual parking rules otherwise you will be the first to be woken up and asked to move your car. The place starts to fill up with day visitors from 730 at the latest and is full from around 10001100.",

The night was quiet despite the road being nearby.EDIT A few meters away right on the street there is another parking lot thats where we stood. There is a small playground almost direct access to the river and 4G internet. The parking lot is in front of the small caf mentioned in the text if asked it is okay to stay overnight there even without consumption. Theres delicious coffee in the morning.",

Turned out to be a wonderful alternative. The houses seem deserted but it is possible that they will still be used  maintained from time to time. So check out beforehand Stayed here in August 2020. Coming from Senj after the bridge behind the empty restaurant turn left at the 60 sign. Then further left around the curve. The beginning of the street is still tarred and the houses are inhabited then it becomes a gravel road but easily accessible by bus. Steep path partly narrow. We were traveling with a Sprinter about 5m long without a 4x4. RIGHTLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONGER MOBILE You can turn around at the top of the parking space. If you go past the last houses a footpath leads up the mountain and after about 10 minutes you have a wonderful view of the sea and islands but the photo was taken further above.

Along the main road youll see a sign Bjele Stiene shortly afterbefore Jasenak. From there is a good 4kms of rough gravel road with plenty of potholes until reaching the parking spot. Theres space for 3 vans at most. You can either walk up to the trailhead of Bjele Stiene or drive up to the other parking lot last photograph. However the road is even worse and steeper  no motorhomes past this point Whichever choice youll have a quiet night and I doubt anyone will say anything. I stayed here for one night without problems.

Warning you cannot drive directly to the 13th kilometer from here you have to walk the 4 km We decided on this location for parking sleeping because it is definitely not in the nature reserve the 13th kilometer is on the edge of it. The nature reserve officially has the highest protection regulations that exist for nature areas. However we do not know whether these will be checked. The journey from Begova Razdoljia is about 20 minutes on a gravel road. But this has no large potholes or similar. and is easy to drive even from an old VW T4 and leads through beautiful nature",

Parking is expensive in high season but it includes the shuttle bus tofrom Lake Tovel which is about 4.5km away. A nice path to the lake also starts in front of the car park Le Gare path about 2.5 hours. We went with the shuttle and the return we did the downhill path.Next to the parking lot there is a restaurant. Eating there parking is free.There is a downstream cash desk to pay.

Only cars are parked in the immediate vicinity. View directly onto the riverbed from where you can walk about 200m to the flowing river. Great swimming opportunities beautiful view of the mountains and despite many visitors you can spend a very quiet and relaxed time here. Highly recommended Tip there are many places to park around the lake At the place mentioned here there is probably space for a maximum of 2 campers.
