Only 20 meters away in the direction of the sports center there is an area reserved for sorting recycling waste. At the top of the parking lot there is a bridge with signage indicating various hiking departures as well as mountain biking trails. I would say that the strong point of this car park is that it is free  unlimited quiet to sleep at night from 9 p.m. there is hardly any passing car and only 16 minutes by Car Postal take bus n  453 of the cable cars that lead to MONTE SAN SALVATORE.

As the criticism of parking in Milan is it is something to take into account.I didnt stay the night because I imagine there would be a lot of traffic with cars parking very early but I understand that it could be done. But to visit Milan for the whole day and leave afterwards I think there is nothing better.PS if you can park near the drivers booth even better",

The first 30 minutes are always free just go to the parking meter and print the ticket without inserting any money. The parking meter does not give change but accepts electronic payments in contactless mode. The ticket is valid for both car parks. The main road is nearby but at night it seems quite quiet. The bell does not ring at night we hear the first tolls at 800. Excellent location for walking to downtown shops.",
