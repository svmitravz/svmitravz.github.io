Parking here only costs between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. and standing overnight is free. However the vehicle must not be over 1.90 meters high so this parking lot is not suitable for motorhomes but is suitable for smaller vans and cars overnight because the parking spaces are also quite small. However we also saw someone who simply pushed the height barrier away so if you dare you can bypass the height limit. The view of the lake is really very beautiful",

We were able to stretch out our hammocks and enjoy the view A small cool stream allowed us to shower.

An allinclusive column supplies drinking water electricity and drainage both gray and black but only with cassette or portable tank. The column is not very clean and no one to supervise it. Ive read that you can park for free while you pay for the services but since nothing is displayed at the entrance and there are no guards it can be considered free like many other Slovenian realities. Excellent if you want to spend the day at the spa or even just to sleep in safety for one night the gate is closed at midnight and reopened at six in the morning.

Coming from Senj after the bridge behind the empty restaurant turn left at the 60 sign. Then further left around the curve. The beginning of the street is still tarred and the houses are inhabited then it becomes a gravel road but easily accessible by bus. Steep path partly narrow. We were traveling with a Sprinter about 5m long without a 4x4. RIGHTLY NOT RECOMMENDED FOR LONGER MOBILE You can turn around at the top of the parking space.

Theres space for 3 vans at most. You can either walk up to the trailhead of Bjele Stiene or drive up to the other parking lot last photograph. However the road is even worse and steeper  no motorhomes past this point Whichever choice youll have a quiet night and I doubt anyone will say anything. I stayed here for one night without problems.

If that doesnt bother you spend a wonderful night with a wonderful view.Right next to the wind turbine there is a small bunker that is accessible.Attention Google Maps doesnt know the street yet Its best to enter VE Rudine and drive past the wind turbines to the last wind turbine at the end of the street.",
